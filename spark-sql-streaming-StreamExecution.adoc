== [[StreamExecution]] StreamExecution -- Execution Environment for Streaming Query

`StreamExecution` manages execution of a streaming query for a `SQLContext` and a link:spark-sql-streaming-sink.adoc[Sink]. It requires a link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[LogicalPlan] to know the `Source` objects from which records are periodically pulled down.

`StreamExecution` is a link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQuery.adoc[StreamingQuery] with additional attributes:

* [[checkpointRoot]] `checkpointRoot`
* link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[LogicalPlan]
* link:spark-sql-streaming-sink.adoc[Sink]
* `Trigger`

`StreamExecution` <<start, starts a thread of execution>> that runs a streaming query concurrently (and <<runBatches, polls for new records in the sources to create a batch>>).

NOTE: The time between batches - 10 milliseconds - is fixed (i.e. not configurable).

`StreamExecution` can be in three states:

* `INITIALIZED` when the instance was created.
* `ACTIVE` when batches are pulled from the sources.
* `TERMINATED` when batches were successfully processed or the query stopped.

| [[currentDurationsMs]] `currentDurationsMs`
|

| [[id]] `id`

| [[microBatchThread]] `microBatchThread`
a| Thread of execution to run a streaming query concurrently with the name as `stream execution thread for [prettyIdString]` (that uses <<prettyIdString, prettyIdString>> for logging purposes).

When started, `microBatchThread` sets the so-called call site and <<runBatches, runs batches>>.

NOTE: `microBatchThread` is Java's https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html[java.util.Thread].

[TIP]

a| Pretty-identified string for identification in logs (with <<name, name>> if defined).

```
// query name set
queryName [id = xyz, runId = abc]

// no query name
[id = xyz, runId = abc]
```

| [[runId]] `runId`
|

| [[startLatch]] `startLatch`
| Java's https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CountDownLatch.html[java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch] with count `1`.

Used when `StreamExecution` is <<start, started>> to get notified when `StreamExecution` <<runBatches, has posted a QueryStartedEvent>>.

| [[state]] `state`
a| Java's https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicReference.html[java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference] for the three different states a streaming query execution can be:

[TIP]
====
Enable `INFO` or `DEBUG` logging levels for `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.StreamExecution` to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```

Internally, `runBatches` sets the job group as <<runId, runId>>, <<getBatchDescriptionString, getBatchDescriptionString>> and `interruptOnCancel` flag enabled.

NOTE: `runBatches` uses <<sparkSession, SparkSession>> to access `SparkContext` and set the job group.

`runBatches` registers a metric source when link:spark-sql-streaming-properties.adoc#spark.sql.streaming.metricsEnabled[spark.sql.streaming.metricsEnabled] property is enabled (which is disabled by default).

CAUTION: FIXME Metrics

`runBatches` notifies `StreamingQueryListeners` that a streaming query has been started (by <<postEvent, posting a QueryStartedEvent>> with <<id, id>>, <<runId, runId>> and <<name, name>>).

`runBatches` unblocks the <<start, main starting thread>> (by decrementing the count of <<startLatch, startLatch>> that goes to `0` and lets the starting thread continue).

CAUTION: FIXME A picture with two parallel lanes for the starting thread and daemon one for the query.

`runBatches` <<updateStatusMessage, updates status message>> to *Initializing sources*.

`runBatches` then materializes the lazy <<logicalPlan, logicalPlan>>.

`runBatches` disables adaptive query execution (using `spark.sql.adaptive.enabled` property which is disabled by default) as it could change the number of shuffle partitions.

`runBatches` sets <<offsetSeqMetadata, offsetSeqMetadata>> variable.

`runBatches` sets <<state, state>> to `ACTIVE` (only when the current state is `INITIALIZING` that prevents from repeating the initialization)

NOTE: `runBatches` does the work only when first started (i.e. when <<state, state>> is `INITIALIZING`).

`runBatches` decrements the count of <<initializationLatch, initializationLatch>>.

CAUTION: FIXME `initializationLatch` so what?

`runBatches` requests <<triggerExecutor, TriggerExecutor>> to execute a so-called <<batch-runner, batch runner>>.

NOTE: `runBatches` is used exclusively when `StreamExecution` starts the <<microBatchThread, execution thread for a streaming query>> (i.e. the thread that runs the micro-batches of this stream).

==== [[batch-runner]] Batch Runner

*Batch Runner* (aka `batchRunner`) is an executable block executed by <<triggerExecutor, triggerExecutor>>.

`batchRunner` <<startTrigger, starts trigger calculation>>.

If <<state, state>> is not `TERMINATED` (which means that the streaming query should be executed), `batchRunner`  executes the current batch and <<reportTimeTaken, reports time taken>>.

The current batch branches off per <<currentBatchId, currentBatchId>>.

.Current Batch Execution per currentBatchId
[cols="1,1",options="header",width="100%"]

1. Setting Job Description as <<getBatchDescriptionString, getBatchDescriptionString>>

```
DEBUG Stream running from [committedOffsets] to [availableOffsets]
```

| 1. <<constructNextBatch, constructNextBatch>>
|===

If there is <<dataAvailable, data available>>, `batchRunner` marks <<currentStatus, currentStatus>> with `isDataAvailable` enabled.

[NOTE]
====
You can check out the status of a link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQuery.adoc[streaming query] using link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQuery.adoc#status[status] method.

[source, scala]
----
scala> spark.streams.active(0).status
res1: org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.StreamingQueryStatus =
{
  "message" : "Waiting for next trigger",
  "isDataAvailable" : false,
  "isTriggerActive" : false
}
----
====

`batchRunner` then <<updateStatusMessage, updates the status message>> to "Processing new data" and <<runBatch, runs the batch>>.

=== [[toDebugString]] `toDebugString` Method

You can call `toDebugString` on `StreamExecution` to learn about the internals.

```
scala> out.asInstanceOf[StreamExecution].toDebugString
res3: String =
"
=== Continuous Query ===
Name: memStream
Current Offsets: {FileSource[hello]: #0}

Current State: ACTIVE
Thread State: RUNNABLE

Logical Plan:
FileSource[hello]


     "
```

=== [[start]] Starting Streaming Query (on Execution Thread) -- `start` Method

[source, scala]
----
start(): Unit
----

When called, `start` prints the following INFO message to the logs:

```
INFO Starting [id]. Use [resolvedCheckpointRoot] to store the query checkpoint.
```

`start` then sets <<microBatchThread, microBatchThread>> as a daemon thread and starts it.

NOTE: `start` uses Java's link:++https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#start--++[java.lang.Thread.start] to run the streaming query on a separate execution thread.

NOTE: When started, a streaming query runs in its own execution thread on JVM.

In the end, `start` waits until <<startLatch, startLatch>> has counted down to zero (which is when `StreamExecution` <<runBatches, starts running batches>> so there is some pause in the main thread's execution to wait till the streaming query execution thread starts).

NOTE: `start` is used exclusively when `StreamingQueryManager` is requested to link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQueryManager.adoc#startQuery[start a streaming query].
