== [[FlatMapGroupsWithState]] FlatMapGroupsWithState Unary Logical Operator

`FlatMapGroupsWithState` is a unary logical operator (aka `LogicalPlan`) that is <<creating-instance, created>> to represent the following operators in link:spark-sql-streaming-KeyValueGroupedDataset.adoc[KeyValueGroupedDataset]:

* link:spark-sql-streaming-KeyValueGroupedDataset.adoc#mapGroupsWithState[mapGroupsWithState]

* link:spark-sql-streaming-KeyValueGroupedDataset.adoc#flatMapGroupsWithState[flatMapGroupsWithState]

NOTE: `mapGroupsWithState` uses `flatMapGroupsWithState` for its work (and is then really its edge case).

[NOTE]
====
`FlatMapGroupsWithState` is translated to:

* `FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec` physical operator in link:spark-sql-streaming-FlatMapGroupsWithStateStrategy.adoc[FlatMapGroupsWithStateStrategy]  execution planning strategy for streaming Datasets (aka streaming plans)

* `MapGroupsExec` physical operator in `BasicOperators` execution planning strategy for non-streaming/batch Datasets (aka batch plans)

* [[keyDeserializer]] Key deserializer Catalyst expression
* [[valueDeserializer]] Value deserializer Catalyst expression
* [[groupingAttributes]] Grouping attributes

* [[stateEncoder]] State `ExpressionEncoder`
* [[outputMode]] link:spark-sql-streaming-OutputMode.adoc[OutputMode]
* [[isMapGroupsWithState]] `isMapGroupsWithState` Flag (disabled by default)
* [[timeout]] link:spark-sql-streaming-GroupStateTimeout.adoc[GroupStateTimeout]
